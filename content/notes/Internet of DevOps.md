## Project focus
The Internet of DevOps project is focused on the use and enhancement of DevOps within large organizations developing [[Telecom & CyberPhysical Systems (T-CPS)]]. DevOps is today a standard practice in IT systems but has been lacking behind in many T-CPS industries. The project had the ambition to provide DevOps solutions for these industries, thus addressing their specific requirements and pain-points.
Furthermore, the project aims to develop DevOps tools encompassing visualization tools and dashboard that will allow for developers to get feedback on the software produced.
Finally, the project will be demonstrated in real world environments of telecomunications and 5G,  to automotive industries, consumer eletronics, aerospace & defense industries etc
