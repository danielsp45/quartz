This is basically two different concepts unified as one:
+ Telecom (Telecommunications network) is a group of nodes interconnected by telecommunications links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links may use a variety of technologies of circuit switching, message switching or package switching to pass messages and signals.
+ A cyber-physical system is a computer system in which a mechanism is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms. In cyber-physical systems, physical and software components arfe deeply interwined, able to operate on different spatial and temporal scales. 

### Examples
Examples of CPS include smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, industrial control systems, robotics systems and automatic pilot avionics.
