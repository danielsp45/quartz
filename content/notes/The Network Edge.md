## Access Networks

### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
Toda, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **Digitial Subscriber Line (DSL)** and cable. A residence typically obtains DSL INternet acess from the same local telephone company taht provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its **ISP**. 

DSL is the primary form of broadband internet access and uses exisitng telephone wiring to transmit data via a DSL modem. The data over DSL phone line goes to internet and the voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net. 

ISP stands for _Internet Service Provider_ which is a company that provides companies and individuals the access to the internet. 

### Cable Network
When we transmit a bit through the network, that bit is going to get kicked around and transmitted many times. These bit passed by many **physical medium** in order to get to its destiny. 
Therefore, as you can imagine there are many media types that let us transmit information. And this medium can take many shapes and forms and does not have to take the same type throught all of the transmition of one packet. 

Some of these mediums are:

#### Twisted-Pair Copper Wire
This is the least expensive and most used guided transmition medium. It consists of two insulated copper wires, each about 1mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern. The wires are twisted together in order to reduce eletrical interference. 

#### Coaxial Cable
Like the twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but the two conductors are concentruc rather than parallel. This allows the cable to achieve high data transmition rates.
This type of cable is quite common in cable television systems. 

#### Fiber Optics
An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conductes pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber cable can support tremendious bit rates. 
Fiber optics is also immune to electromagnetic interference, have a very low signal attenuation up to 100 km and are very hard to tap. 

#### Terrestral Radio Channels
Radio Channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are an attractive medium because they require no physical wire to be installed, can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can potentially carry a signal for ling distances. 

#### Satellite Radio Channels
A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations.
